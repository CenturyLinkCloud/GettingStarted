This video series shows how to quickly create a Microsoft SQL Server Relational Database.

### Introduction

The Microsoft SQL Server (MS-SQL) database is a comprehensive and integrated data management and analysis software application that enables the reliable management of mission-critical information. With a Relational DB, you can create, modify, and delete tables, as well as select, insert, and delete data from existing tables.

There are two ways to create a relational database from the DBaaS dashboard. You can click *Create* in the left-hand menu, then select *Relational DB*, or you can select *Services* and then *Relational DB*. This method will take you to a list of your existing databases, where you can create a new one by clicking on the green button at the top of the page.
