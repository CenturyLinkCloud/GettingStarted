This video series shows how to quickly create a Microsoft SQL Server Relational Database.

### Introduction

The Microsoft SQL Server (MS-SQL) database is a comprehensive and integrated data management and analysis software application that enables the reliable management of mission-critical information. With a Relational DB, you can create, modify, and delete tables, as well as select, insert, and delete data from existing tables.
