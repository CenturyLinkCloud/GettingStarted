Whether you’re taking a development server into production or faced with a seasonal related traffic spike, we understand that throughout the lifespan of a server you may need to increase or decrease the memory available to your server.  This guide will walk you through the process of editing your cloud servers memory.

**Navigate to Server Status Page**

Changing your servers memory is very similar to changing its CPUs. Hover over the Memory Usage graph & the edit button will appear.  Click on the edit button & either enter the desired amount of memory available to your server in the textbox provided or use the slider to increase or decrease the value. 

Once you’re satisfied with your entry, click the ‘apply’ button.

Depending on your edits a reboot may be required for change to take affect.
