Whether you’re taking a development server into production or faced with a seasonal related traffic spike, we understand that throughout the lifespan of a server you may need to increase or decrease the number of CPUs available to your server.

**Navigate to Server Status Page**

Hover over the CPU Usage graph & the edit button will appear.  Click on the edit button & either enter the desired number of CPUs to your server in the textbox provided or use the slider to increase or decrease the value. 

Once you’re satisfied with your entry, click the ‘apply’ button.

Depending on your edits a reboot may be required for change to take affect.
