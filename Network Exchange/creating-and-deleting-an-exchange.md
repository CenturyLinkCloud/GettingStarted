This video shows how to create an Exchange with CenturyLink Cloud (CLC) and Colocation  Endpoints.

### Introduction

Network Exchange provides secure, high-speed, redundant, automated network connections between disparate IT environments allowing for a true hybrid environment. The Network Exchange portal allows for self-managed connections, including the creation, modification and deletion, via the portal, combined with automation via Software Defined Networking.

### Log-in to the CenturyLink Cloud Portal

Log-in to the Cloud Application Management (CAM) portal using your CAM credentials or your CenturyLink Cloud credentials.

The exchange will show a "BUILDING" status until it is complete. Then it will change to "ACTIVE."

Once active, you can view each endpoint by expanding the information under the exchange.

### View Colocation Connection Instructions
