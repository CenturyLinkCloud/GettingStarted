### Introduction

CenturyLink Cloud is limited by contract with Microsoft to sell Azure only to specific countries. This tutorial demonstrates the alert message that will display if the CenturyLink Cloud billing address linked to an admin account is outside the territory permitted by Microsoft.

### Billing Address Must Match Territory

The following error will appear if the CenturyLink Cloud billing address associated with the user and account alias is outside the territory allowed by our contract with Microsoft.

Here's how you might arrive at this error message. After you log into [Cloud Application Manager](https://www.ctl.io/cloud-application-manager), click the **Provider** tab on the top toolbar.

Then click **New Provider** on the left navigation bar.

Select **Azure Resource Manager** to build a customer account in the current Microsoft Azure. Note: this is the new Azure, not the classic Azure. The dialog box that appears will enable you to create a new Azure customer account. Add a name for the account and select the **Create a new Azure customer account** option.

Click **Connect a CenturyLink Cloud Account** and enter your CLC account admin credentials. This ties Azure directly into the CenturyLink Cloud billing service.
