### Introduction

This tutorial will show you how to deploy a new managed instance within an existing AWS VPC using [Cloud Application Manager](https://www.ctl.io/cloud-application-manager).

### Modify the Deployment Policy

Once you have [deployed a management appliance](../cloudapplicationmanager/making-instance-managed-cloud-application-manager.md) within your AWS VPC, you're ready to start deploying managed instances within that VPC. First, you'll need to modify the deployment policy you'd like to use.

![Edit the Deployment Policy](../images/cloud-application-manager-deploy1.png)

Within the **Edit** mode for the deployment policy, set the **Delegate OS Management** toggle to **ON**.

The **Delegate Managed OS** terms window will appear. Accept the terms and select **Enable**. Select **Save** on the edited deployment policy.

### Ready to Deploy

Now you can deploy a new managed instance using the deployment policy that you just edited.

The **Make Managed** process will run on the instance.

When complete, the **Activity** screen will be updated stating **Instance Successfully Deployed**.
