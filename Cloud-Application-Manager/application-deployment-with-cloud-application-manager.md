### Introduction

Cloud Application Manager is a scalable platform for deploying enterprise mission-critical applications across any cloud infrastructure &ndash; private, public or hosted. It provides interactive visualization to automate application provisioning, including configuration, deployment, scaling, updating and migration of applications in real-time. Cloud Application Manager manages both traditional and cloud-native applications provisioned on bare metal and virtual machines across any type of infrastructure.

### Log Into Cloud Application Manager

To get started with Cloud Application Manager, sign up for an account and register your cloud service (CenturyLink, AWS or Azure, for example) as a provider.
