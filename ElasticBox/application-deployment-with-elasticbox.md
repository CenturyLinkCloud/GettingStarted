### Introduction

ElasticBox is a scalable platform for deploying enterprise mission-critical applications across any cloud infrastructure &ndash; private, public or hosted. It provides interactive visualization to automate application provisioning, including configuration, deployment, scaling, updating and migration of applications in real-time. ElasticBox manages both traditional and cloud-native applications provisioned on bare metal and virtual machines across any type of infrastructure.
